# Chromatic
Inspired by traditional 2D platformers, Chromatic takes the player through a neon world to
collect paint droplets and face challenging platforming obstacles.
I lead a team of students to build a 2D platformer video game within 24 hours. I designed and implemented the main gameplay mechanics and level using the Godot game engine. This project was submitted for CUHackit 2023 and won the award for “Most Creative Hack”.

## To play: 
Download and unzip ChromaticApp.zip and run the excutable. NOTE: Both files in the zip must be in the same folder for it to run.
